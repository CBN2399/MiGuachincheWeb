# MiGuachincheWeb

MiGuachincheWeb is a web application where users can view and book reservations at the best traditional restaurants in Tenerife (Guachinches). Upon registering, users will be able to view the menus of the restaurants, the main locations, and their whereabouts in different areas of the island. Additionally, they can make reservations (and cancel them), create a list of favorites, etc. On the other hand, the website also serves as a tool for restaurant owners to manage reservations.
